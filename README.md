# Personal Tutorial on Git and GitHub

### Introduction to Git and GitHub
Git is a Version Control System and GitHub is a website based on Git that provides
relevant service

We have central VCS(Version Control System) and Distributed VCS, the diff between them
is the manner of storge.
For central VCS, Files are stored in a server and have only one copy.
Fore distributed VCS, Files are stored in everyone's personal computer, and every one has an 
copy.

So, why do we need distributed VCS? Because it brings many advantages.
1. Files are easy to track and will not be missed, for central VCS, once the cetral Server breaks down,
all relevant files stored in the server will get lost
2. Distributed VCS help facilitate team work
